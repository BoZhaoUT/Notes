-- print literal string
SELECT "Hello, World";

-- rename the column title to "Result", by default it's "Hello, World"
SELECT "Hello, World" AS "Result";

-- another way to rename column title
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy AS "Life Expantancy" FROM Country ORDER BY Name;

-- the keyward "AS" was not mandatory to rename a column title
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy "Life Expantancy" FROM Country ORDER BY Name;

-- simple WHERE clause
SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe';

-- simple WHERE, ORDER BY and Limit
SELECT Name, Continent FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name LIMIT 5;

-- skip first 10
SELECT Name, Continent FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;

-- count the number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country WHERE Population > 10000 and Continent = 'Europe';

-- only count the number of rows wher LifeExpectancy has data
SELECT COUNT(LifeExpectancy) FROM Country;

-- simple insert
INSERT INTO customer (name, address, city, state, zip)
